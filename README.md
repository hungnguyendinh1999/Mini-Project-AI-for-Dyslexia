# Mini-Project: AI for Disability
## Summarization tool

### Installation
- For dependencies for both frontend and server directory, run `npm i`
- For server specifically, also run `npm install -g nodemon`
- Create a file called `api_key.txt` within [server root directory](server) and paste your OpenAI API key in
- If you don't create a file, or if the key doesn't work, this app will assume that this is "Development mode" and will return default summaries

### Run Application
- For server, within the root directory of server, run `nodemon index.js`
- For frontend, within the root directory of frontend, run `npm run dev`
